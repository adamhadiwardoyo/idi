## Key Attributes of Premium Shisha Charcoal
Choosing the right charcoal is crucial for both the consumer experience and your brand's reputation. Here are the core specifications that define a superior product:

- **Low Ash Content:** This is the most critical factor. Premium briquettes, like those from Indo Charcoal Supply, boast an ash content **below 2.5%**. Low ash means a cleaner burn, less residue in the tray, and no alteration of the shisha flavor.
- **Long Burning Time:** A high-quality briquette should burn for at least **1.5 hours** on a standard shisha bowl. This allows for a longer, more enjoyable session without needing to frequently replace coals.
- **High Caloric Value:** Measured in Kcal/kg, a high caloric value (over **7400 Kcal/kg**) indicates intense, consistent heat. This is essential for properly heating the shisha tobacco and producing thick, flavorful smoke.
- **Odorless & Tasteless:** Briquettes must be made from 100% natural coconut shells and contain no chemical additives. This ensures the charcoal does not produce any unpleasant smells or tastes that could ruin the shisha experience.
- **No Sparking:** Professional-grade briquettes should not spark or crack when lit, guaranteeing a safe and hassle-free experience for the user.

## The Production Process: From Coconut Shell to Premium Briquette
Achieving these premium attributes requires a meticulous production process. It all starts with the **raw material**: mature, dense coconut shells. These shells are then carbonized at high temperatures in specialized kilns to produce high-quality charcoal with a high fixed carbon content.

After carbonization, the charcoal is crushed and mixed with a **natural binder** (typically food-grade tapioca starch) before being molded into uniform shapes like cubes or hexagons. This process, known as briquetting, is key to achieving consistent density and burn times. The briquettes are then dried to remove all moisture, ensuring they are ready for packaging and shipping.
