## A Great Product is Only Half the Journey
You have selected a premium coconut charcoal briquette with excellent specifications. But the journey from the factory in Indonesia to your warehouse is complex and fraught with potential challenges. A truly professional supplier doesn't just master production; **they master logistics**. This guide provides full transparency into the international shipping process, ensuring your investment is protected every step of the way.

### Step 1: The First Line of Defense – Professional Packaging & Palletizing
Before your order faces the rigors of ocean transit, it must be impeccably packaged. This involves more than just a box. The master cartons are stacked securely on wooden pallets, conforming to **ISPM 15 international standards** for wood treatment. The entire pallet is then tightly wrapped in multiple layers of stretch film. This process, known as **palletizing**, creates a stable, unified block that prevents boxes from shifting and being crushed during transit.

### Step 2: The Art of Container Loading
Maximizing container space while ensuring safety is a skill. We typically use **20-foot or 40-foot containers**, with capacities of approximately 18-19 tons and 26-27 tons, respectively. Using a 'floor loading' or 'hand-stacked' method, our experienced team carefully arranges each master carton to optimize space and distribute weight evenly. This prevents movement during the sea journey and ensures the container is stable and safe for transport.

### Step 3: Navigating the Paperwork – Essential Export Documents
Seamless international trade runs on accurate documentation. A professional supplier manages this complex process for you. Key documents include:
- **Bill of Lading (B/L):** The primary contract between the shipper and the carrier, acting as a receipt and title to the goods.
- **Commercial Invoice & Packing List:** Details the transaction, value of the goods, and a full list of what is being shipped.
- **Certificate of Origin (COO):** Verifies that the goods were manufactured in Indonesia, which can be crucial for customs clearance and tariffs.
- **Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS):** Provides information on the product's properties and handling, often required by shipping lines.

Handling these documents correctly is critical to avoiding costly delays at customs.
